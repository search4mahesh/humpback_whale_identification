# humpback_whale_identification

This training data contains thousands of images of humpback whale flukes. 
Individual whales have been identified by researchers and given an Id. 
The challenge is to predict the whale Id of images in the test set. 
What makes this such a challenge is that there are only a few examples for each of 3,000+ whale Ids.
#Data
File descriptions
train.zip - a folder containing the training images
train.csv - maps the training Image to the appropriate whale Id. Whales that are not predicted to have a label identified in the training data should be labeled as new_whale.
test.zip - a folder containing the test images to predict the whale Id
